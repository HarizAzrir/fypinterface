"My favorite online shopping app out of the rest (Qoo10/Lazada/ezbuy) etc. Shopee is very easy to use, it's addictive.

I use it for fun now, just buying fun little things under $5 or $10, something that would cost $20-$30 in retail shops outside.

"A shopping app that started out okay, became better, rose to huge popularity, and now is mediocre. Shopping on Shopee doesn't feel trustworthy now. Products from sellers are hit and miss in quality, and yet returns are slow and difficult when that happens. This is unlike Lazada that supports returns well for cases with genuine reasons. Shopee also doesn't allow us to review items past a certain purchase timeframe. This means we cannwarn other buyers if a product is a dud / bad quality.","shopping  started  okay,  became  better,  rose  huge  popularity,  mediocre.  shopping  feel  trustworthy  now.  products  hit  miss  quality,  yet  returns  slow  difficult  happens.  unlike  lazada  supports  returns  well  cases  genuine  reasons.  also  allow  us  review  past  certain  purchase  timeframe.  means  cannwarn  buyers  product  dud  /  quality.",2,1

"Shopee is by far the best Online shopping platform I have been enjoying for years. I appreciate having Gold membership, which I attain by shopping wisely with the stacking of Shopee and Seller vouchers, in addtion to Credit card promotions and redeeming Shopee coins. It is also worthwhile to be on their Beauty Rewards programme. Do your wallet a favour because you can purchase almost everything you desire / need. Customer service is great when you need resolution with defective / missing items.","far  best  online  shopping  platform  enjoying  years.  appreciate  gold  membership,  attain  shopping  wisely  stacking  vouchers,  addtion  credit  card  promotions  redeeming  coins.  also  worthwhile  beauty  rewards  programme.  wallet  favour  purchase  almost  everything  desire  /  need.  customer  service  great  need  resolution  defective  /  missing  items.",5,0

The Shoppee Guarantee is fake and helps only the scam seller. Shoppee will not refund you if its a scam as they need the sellers consent AND return of the goods before they refund. The scammer will never consent to the refund and will make it very difficult to return the goods. And even after you return the flawed good they wont acknowledge receipt. So please please do not rely on this app. Do own research and buy only from sellers with long established accounts and many good reviews.,guarantee  fake  helps  scam  seller.  refund  scam  need  consent  return  goods  refund.  scammer  never  consent  refund  make  difficult  return  goods.  even  return  flawed  good  wont  acknowledge  receipt.  please  please  rely  app.  research  buy  long  established  accounts  many  good  reviews.,1,1

"Having some issue with shopee candy. Ths shopee candy hangs and not responding after the candy switches it colours at level 646. Was chatting with the live agent after I've waited 12 mins for an agent and suddenly the chat was gone too and I have to start queueing for an agent all over again. To the game developer, whenever there is a newly added feature to the games (shopee candy or shopee bubbles), the app will hang.","issue  candy.  ths  candy  hangs  responding  candy  switches  colours  level  646.  chatting  live  agent  i've  waited  12  mins  agent  suddenly  chat  gone  start  queueing  agent  again.  game  developer,  whenever  newly  added  feature  games  (shopee  candy  bubbles),  hang.",1,1

"Buggy server and poorly maintained app . I wanted to check out and pay but keep getting server error. My credit card payment went through and got reversed several times. Contacted support but they kept asking me to provide screen shots and telling me to reinstall, try web version. None of it worked. Added a full cart of items and they asked me to do individual bank transfer and send them screen shots. No thanks, I will stick to Lazada and Qoo10.","buggy  server  poorly  maintained  .  wanted  check  pay  keep  getting  server  error.  credit  card  payment  went  got  reversed  several  times.  contacted  support  kept  asking  provide  screen  shots  telling  reinstall,  try  web  version.  none  worked.  added  full  cart  asked  individual  bank  transfer  send  screen  shots.  thanks,  stick  lazada  qoo10.",1,1
Crappy delivery service. J&t Express is a bad example of a good quality delivery service. Their delivery people tend to not deliver the things to you and sign it as delivered or deliver to someone else and that someone else will sign it and keep your items. So it's very bad I'm never trusting shopee ever again,crappy  delivery  service.  j&t  express  example  good  quality  delivery  service.  delivery  people  tend  deliver  things  sign  delivered  deliver  someone  else  someone  else  sign  keep  items.  i'm  never  trusting  ever,1,1

"Honestly used to only use Qoo10 but I feel Shopee is much easier to find the items I need. I tried lazada and amazon but doesn't meet the cut.

"In terms of delivery, it's one of the fastest compared among the other online shopping plaforms and lot of things are much cheaper to buy as well, normally, I will browse around the online plaforms to compare prices and always end up SHOPEE is on my list and also SHOPEE provide daily vouchers for further discounts, one thing I like the best is, sometimes they also have options on free delivery on individual items if you are not in the hurry to receive your items.
