Please DO NOT entrust a single cent to Shopee Pay. This company has serious IT issues in my opinion. The Shopee Pay app deducted money from the wallet after I've removed payment amount and 'payment failed' message. The customer service paid lip service promising refund within 4 working days after investigation that found the error. The refund never materialised and they are so incompetent as to redirect the case back into customer service mode ALL OVER again like there's no continuation!,please  entrust  single  cent  pay.  company  serious  issues  opinion.  pay  deducted  money  wallet  i've  removed  payment  amount  'payment  failed'  message.  customer  service  paid  lip  service  promising  refund  within  4  working  days  investigation  found  error.  refund  never  materialised  incompetent  redirect  case  back  customer  service  mode  like  there's  continuation!,1,1

Shopee delivery service is getting worst ever since shopee started taking the courier service for themselve.

"The platform is easy to use unlike Qoo10 which is not user-friendly. Switching to Shopee Pay is easy unlike QPay. The latter needs to up its ante.

I have been using Shopee for several years now. It's a really affordable online shopping app. Maybe it's my wish they make food groceries delivery fee a little cheaper like the normal items we can get for 1.49 shipping fee. Also if u can improve the customer service chat services will be good! I don't like to be in line waiting to chat more than 18 persons waiting to chat with CS. This can improve..So far I have a good experience with Shopee.

There's some deals that might be cheaper than Lazada at times. Would recommend to check both platforms for the better deal. The voucher system in Shopee is a joke though. You can claim as much vouchers as you like but don't expect to be able to use it since they share a common maximum times it can be used among all their users.

Update2: tried turning off wifi and using my data to login instead and it works! So i would advice those who are unable to login to try using their data instead! Update1: just tried logging in again just in time for the 9am shake but still unable to login in. Have already missed a few shakes since yesterday.. i am using samsung s7. Have tried to login on other phones as well. Impossible. Same error message I couldnt add things into the cart because it kept saying NETWORK ERROR. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER. So i thought it might be my phone's problem and i uninstalled and installed the app again but now i cant even login and it keeps saying the same thing! NETWORK ERROR. PMEASE TRY AGAIN LATER. And seems like i am not the only one facing this problem. The customer service is only available from mon-fri. So means there is no one to help us at all.

Easy to navigate. Keeps history of purchases so can buy again when required. Shopee consultants provide good follow up e. g. I booked an order for a frying wok but failed to notice it was only for the glass cover lid of a well known brand as the photo posted by the seller was that of a wok with lid. I received a text from a shoppee consultant to clarify if I intended to buy just a wok cover and that's when I realised my mistake. I was guided on how to make a cancellation and obtained a refund.,easy  navigate.  keeps  history  purchases  buy  required.  consultants  provide  good  follow  e.  g.  booked  order  frying  wok  failed  notice  glass  cover  lid  well  known  brand  photo  posted  wok  lid.  received  text  consultant  clarify  intended  buy  wok  cover  that's  realised  mistake.  guided  make  cancellation  obtained  refund.,5,0

"I have been using Shopee for online purchase for 2 years until I made a bad purchase due to the seller's misleading claim of being the cheapest. The seller sold Covid-19 test kits at 2.6 times the market price and misled by choice of 6, 10, 20, 5 test kits for the purchase. 1st picture shows a box of 5 test kits.

Very bad shopping platform. Many scammer sellers have found a loop hole on the shipment days. They will indicate items are shipped but in fact did not. There is no way for buyers to make a dispute once the max shipment days have reached. Especially for shipments through normal mail and no tracking is available. I am one such buyer who got scammed.

"App is fine but Shopee as a shopping experience is bad. Buyers are at a disadvantage if you need to return (the item is marketed with 7 days return policy) or cancel an order even before the seller has shipped. The return process is cumbersome as you have to send the item to selected drop off points. I am switching back to using Lazada for most of my needs, as they at least make returns and cancellations easy.

The bad experience app that I come across. The delivery that always the worst case!!! Always leave the item without informing don't even take a picture or send text to informed. You must go in to the app to check your item on yourself!!!

Think twice before you guy purchase.

This is such a terrible app ridden with unscrupulous sellers. Sellers have a tendency to change the product variation from what is ordered to clear their stock. Returning and refunding is so inconvenient you end up just taking what the seller dumps on you. Reviewing and rating is so damn difficult as well. Can't even leave a review to the seller that tried to pua stunt.,terrible  ridden  unscrupulous  sellers.  tendency  change  product  variation  ordered  clear  stock.  returning  refunding  inconvenient  end  taking  dumps  you.  reviewing  rating  damn  difficult  well.  can't  even  leave  review  tried  pua  stunt.,1,1

"Dear fellow Singaporeans, make sure whatever you shop, be extra more careful. Although products are cheap, quality sometimes very 👎👎 And when you ask for a refund, the seller will say , you are not reasonable ,and when you want to cancelled the order, they will try to find ways , and the order will still be on its way to you, although u already cancelled it n demand refund. And Shopee does not help much. They will asked you to email/call/ explain/ sent photos to Shopee , investigate further n etc. which frankly speaking, it does not help. You ll be at the losing end, wasting time and don't get back your refund. Just be careful , when you buy online products.","dear  fellow  singaporeans,  make  sure  whatever  shop,  extra  careful.  although  products  cheap,  quality  sometimes  thumbs_downthumbs_down  ask  refund,  say  ,  reasonable  ,and  want  cancelled  order,  try  find  ways  ,  order  still  way  you,  although  u  already  cancelled  n  demand  refund.  help  much.  asked  email/call/  explain/  sent  photos  ,  investigate  n  etc.  frankly  speaking,  help.  losing  end,  wasting  time  get  back  refund.  careful  ,  buy  online  products.",1,1

Pretty good experience shopping with shoppee. They will auto refund in the system when goods took too long to ship. I did not need to negotiate with the seller.
