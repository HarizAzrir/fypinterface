Derek Monin,"The search function used to be very good and would give relevant items for your search. Now, it is cluttered up with unrelated items that are barely relevant and not what I'm looking for. Shipping used to not require vouchers, but now they require vouchers and only give out limited amounts once in a blue moon. Vouchers are limited and require you to pay by Shopeepay.

Rei Asuka,"The app is workng fine. The issue i had was the shopee pet game. 1) Half the time, it will get stuck at 99% loading. 2) 20% of the time, it will not be able to connect to server after you completeed the music minigame and have to replay the minigame again. 3) Worst of all is the soccer minigame. Even if the goalie is at one end of the goal, it can still block the ball at the other end, making it totally based on luck. Sometimes, it doesn't even need to touch the ball to block it.",1,257,2022-08-14 06:11:42,"Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

Fang Toh,"Decent app, good deals. But as a seller, I have a lot of my photos stolen and used by other sellers without my permission. The report button is useless, I have done many times. The only way that it did work was the customer support and having to go through 3h of waiting and explanation. The 2nd and 3rd time around nothing was done even though I provided all links and photo proof.

The transaction should have been smooth and taken less than a minute was unavle to pay for 5 minutes at least.

Kinda like stealing now. Plus, Bad customer service, call so many times no solutions and refuse to escalate higher, keep repeating as if they have text book in front off them. Incompetent. Plus, nearly 10pm every call they pick up will get cut off. I CALL TWICE, once they pick up they cut it off.

Michael Chuah,"You are an idiot if you click on the ""Order Received"" button. Never click on it. You will lose all protection. You will not be able to do any return or refund after clicking on it. Once you do, Shopee will not help you at all and just string you along with their ""help"". Yes, you are supposed to ""return"" something before you even ""receive"" it. Amazing right?

The app is VERY unresponsive. Happening for a long time already despite multiple updates. Lazada better. Now vouchers are limited to ShopeePay only, which forces user to ShopeePay. Charge $1 admin fee (that's 100 shopee coins) if topped up with credit/debit cards. ABSOLUTELY contradicting.

Janan (Puzzle Lover),This is such a terrible app ridden with unscrupulous sellers. Sellers have a tendency to change the product variation from what is ordered to clear their stock. Returning and refunding is so inconvenient you end up just taking what the seller dumps on you. Reviewing and rating is so damn difficult as well. Can't even leave a review to the seller that tried to pua stunt.,1,1,2022-10-07 11:06:25,"Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear that your experience with Shopee was less than perfect.

Is already a brand new issued card. As seller, I never intend to use speedpost economy or other courier services.

Pauline Huan,Deals are indeed great but I decide to update my review after they mention my 1 carton of milk powder went lost!!! This was only informed after some days after having to check with them. They only provide refund to my order but how about my waiting time and the great discount that becomes lost!!! I cannot imagine how a big and heavy carton could get lost. I never experience this at all with all other platform for a big and heavy item. I would prefer an exact replacement than refund!!!,1,41,2021-12-07 10:49:41,"Thank you for giving Shopee a 5-star review! We're excited to be part of your online shopping experience.

I had purchased some vouchers for Malaysia Boleh and it clearly shows 3 locations for redemption. But due to the app limitations, not all products can be redeemed at all the 3 locations and they have to place it in the T&C text below. As a frequent client of Shopee, usually we will check the location first because it is the most important for us since there is no logic to claim something far away from where we stay. But despite this issue, shopee does not honor the refund despite they admit it is the issue with the app. Really stuck up service to the core. App limitation but place the risk on the buyer side.

However, it is difficult to find the vouchers at later stage and I thought some went missing. Wasted so much time trying to locate it when I want to use it. Why do you need to separate Deals vouchers and E-vouchers that we bought under different sectors?

A Google user,Very bad shopping platform. Many scammer sellers have found a loop hole on the shipment days. They will indicate items are shipped but in fact did not. There is no way for buyers to make a dispute once the max shipment days have reached. Especially for shipments through normal mail and no tracking is available. I am one such buyer who got scammed.

Em H,Shopee's shipping via shopee express is terrible. I made 4 separate purchases on 4 separate days and paid 4 times for shipping. My items were already in country for 4 days indicating out for delivery. Reasons for delay is because shopee express was waiting for 1 more item so that items can all be delivered at once. Their convenience at our expense. Not forgetting charging us 4 times for consolidated shipping. Why not deliver my full year worth of orders during christmas at one go then?,1,1,2022-05-28 23:10:56,"Thank you for your review.

A Google user,NOT RECOMMEND! Bad experience with Dispute Resolution... does not help customer with disputes. I made a mistake to think that 'Buy 2 items for $25' to mean get 2 pieces at the price of $25. The item retails for $16; way over priced if only 1 piece at $25.99. Shopee condones sellers' over pricing and profiteering. How to trust such a platform with unscrupulous sellers. Shopee deleted my 1 star rating given to the seller!!!!!

Victor Mitchell,Please do not buy from Shopee platform. There are other better option for buyer. Shopee is a f up company. Selling spoilt item in its platform. When there is a problem with the purchase the sellers will not respond and Shopee will close the case in favour of the sellers. I guess Shopee getting money from sellers so they only care about sellers and Don't bother about buyers interest. I have bought from other platforms and they really follow up on their deliveries and Good item. Shopee = Horrible,1,1,2021-04-22 09:08:33,"Thank you for your review.

Melvin Lai,The Shoppee Guarantee is fake and helps only the scam seller. Shoppee will not refund you if its a scam as they need the sellers consent AND return of the goods before they refund. The scammer will never consent to the refund and will make it very difficult to return the goods. And even after you return the flawed good they wont acknowledge receipt. So please please do not rely on this app. Do own research and buy only from sellers with long established accounts and many good reviews.,1,0,2021-03-18 16:51:33,"Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

Sindy Koay,I noticed one thing in shopee that we couldn't withdraw money from deposit in shopee pay. It is a hassle to spend effort to reach out live agent to request withdrawal and it is subject to so called approval from shopee. I am wondering why I couldn't withdraw deposit with just a single click but shopee make it so hard for buyer! I never knew it will be so tough to get my own money out from my own pocket still need to go thru a third party! I feel as if my own money is being locked with shopee.,1,43,2021-11-13 18:23:05,,,most_relevant,com.shopee.sg,1

Lee Yew (Dee),有风险，没保障，9流客户服务…有问题都是我们消费者的问题… 如果这地址是我亲手写的我可接受！但是你的你Shopee app 没进过我同意帮我改的！我同一天下两张单，上一张地址是我自己写的也加在我常用地址，之后我看回改去我ic地址了！谁的问题？你们给的可跟卖家联系功能，是用来聊天的？所以卖家他只看到单，10个小时看不到我信息是合理的… 幸好是几十块马币的东西，如果是高价产品你们又是这种态度真的不知道找谁！！我个人觉得在Shopee买东西，我们客户没 保障！而且这件事，卖家不负责，在app里的订单改不到地址！只会把问题推完给顾客，还觉得自己一卡问题都没有！这种处理事情的态度，太小气 ！,1,1,2022-09-30 22:19:12,"Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

Just for a moment,The live agent named IKMAL is a joke. Doesn't do his job properly and I only found out after I spoke to another live agent. Have had the lousiest shopping experience. Huge amount of sellers intentionally selling subpar products. Return process is a nightmare. Live agent chat requires you to wait forever without an actual solution. No wonder shopee's shares went down & business is declining. Even for a longtime user like me I will start avoid making transaction on the app.,1,1,2022-08-15 14:41:49,,,newest,com.shopee.sg,1

The tricky part is it comes with condition you have to wait for a month to receive the items that's not efficiency. Especially some shops did not state from which country or when is the date we can receive before we buy the item is just shipping date! These have to be improved to be more competitive against other online shopping.,3,5,2019-12-09 12:30:42,"Hey, :D

Skai Chan,"Advantages: Many items are (1) cheaper than other apps' and (2) shipping is usually reasonably fast. Disadvantages: (1) App slows down after a while and requires restart. Reinstalling it and clearing cache don't help. (2) Many sellers are using images of different items, although some are quite similar. (3) What I hate most is that Shopee is generally siding the sellers even with clear evidence that items received are different.

Cephylite CYL,There's some deals that might be cheaper than Lazada at times. Would recommend to check both platforms for the better deal. The voucher system in Shopee is a joke though.

A Google user,1. it has become laggy. 2. they should screen their sellers to protect buyers. Some buyers are real scammers. 3. this app is still more user friendly than q10 and ezbuy 4. should give better vouchers q10 has better vouchers. 5. the coins are very little compared to q10. 6. some times it is difficult to find a product as they do not have picture recognition 7. the pricing of goods from the same sellers on q10 are more expensive in shopee 8. flash sale needs improvement,3,4,2019-05-23 16:02:05,"Dear

That is how i come up to 6k shopee coin as 30% of $200 is $60 or 6k shopee coins.

Like the idea of cash back and daily discount coupon, but do extend their validity so that there's more flexibility for users. On hindsight, I'm not sure if disputes are handled amicably as my shopping experience has been positive so far apart from a couple of minor purchases that did not make the mark for quality and or descriptions.",4,27,2020-10-12 10:03:25,"Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

Muthukumar G,"A couple of problems (or features should i say) though 1. Even if you collect coupons but want to use it later (before expiry), it can still be gone without any notice/warning (it seems this is the way 'vouchers' work in shopee) 2. There are things (e.g. wishlist/membership details) that will take a very long time to update e.g. they update the membership details only on dec 31! The count of wishlist items will remain unchanged for a long time without getting updated",4,11,2020-11-13 11:00:41,,,most_relevant,com.shopee.sg,0

Jaymee Lynch,App is very easy to use and flexible in making changes. Very good development effort. Hope to see some ability in changing views from grid to list mode.

Jason Lee,I have been a regular user of the online purchase platform and I am happy with the service provided.

It is also becoming more competitive by introducing more coupons and introducing interactive activities. Room for improvement: 1. Allow user review on return/refund items, 2. Especially for items that are always on ""discounted price"", when it is on flash deal, there must be visibility on the usual ""discounted price"" vs ""flash deals price"" for customers comparision.",5,59,2019-06-08 23:16:46,"Hi,

In fact, some products I found on the platform, are much cheaper compared to the ones selling in the physical shop. And, of course, as it's a online platform, some products which are very difficult to find, could be found easily on Shopee platform.

tc thiangmail,"My shopping experience in Shopee is getting better. I like the ability to communicate with the sellers, and making payment is easy through credit card. Any cancellation or refund is also easy, and so far I am happy with the experience. Searching for competitive pricings and product comparison is also easy. It is useful for sellers to upload many pictures of their products to allow buyers to see and fully understand the products well.",5,29,2020-11-07 11:47:04,,,most_relevant,com.shopee.sg,0

Only main issue is that the interface for photo up loading is a pain.

A Google user,"I've been a frequent buyer in shopee for the past few months. All I can say is that shopping is very convenient and item can be delivered at my preferred place. I usually talk with the seller first before proceeding with transaction. On other times, I would order by mistake and request cancellation then once seller approves, Shopee would automatically reverse the bank transaction. For improvements, I think the app could enable COD also as it would capture bigger market (with higher risk).",5,27,2019-05-10 13:55:13,"Hey, :D

Jun Bin Low (DarkNLight),Shopee is really good at their mobile app development with easy-to-use UI and in-app games to keep you engaged while shopping. It can get abit convoluted during sales period (like 9.9) though with the amount of cashback or vouchers or deals thrown at you and you can get slightly overwhelmed.,5,6,2020-09-16 15:00:04,,,most_relevant,com.shopee.sg,0

A Google user,"My favorite online shopping app out of the rest (Qoo10/Lazada/ezbuy) etc. Shopee is very easy to use, it's addictive. The prices are super competitive, as if I'm buying directly from the manufacturer in China itself. I end up buying little things here and there that I didn't realise I needed or wanted. I use it for fun now, just buying fun little things under $5 or $10, something that would cost $20-$30 in retail shops outside. A few days wait for nothing urgent, why not? 😁😁",5,7,2019-11-28 20:51:39,"Hi,

Gwen Phua,Easy to navigate and shopping on the Shopee platform is a breeze! Lots of daily promos and regular sales to keep shoppers happy. Bought many items that were priced cheaper than retail stores and items are delivered right to your doorstep. Shoppers' reviews are also authentic and you're rewarded with coins that can be used as credits to offset your next purchase. Shopee has the best shopping platform as compared to other online stores.,5,16,2021-03-07 12:33:54,"""Thank you for giving Shopee a 5-star review!

Definitely save some money, by ordering direct from the source, rather than buying from the physical shop.

Zed Virgo,Shopee is a great platform to search for good bargains. But I need to warn that there are also a number of unscrupulous sellers who would purposely deliver to you a different item to what you ordered from them in order to achieve their sales even though they don't carry the product anymore. This happened to me when I bought an item but they purposely delivered a different brand to what I originally ordered. Shopee need to take stern action against these kind of unethical vendors.,5,80,2021-04-11 01:37:27,"""Thank you for giving Shopee a 5-star review!

Molly Ng,Easy to navigate. Keeps history of purchases so can buy again when required. Shopee consultants provide good follow up e. g. I booked an order for a frying wok but failed to notice it was only for the glass cover lid of a well known brand as the photo posted by the seller was that of a wok with lid. I received a text from a shoppee consultant to clarify if I intended to buy just a wok cover and that's when I realised my mistake. I was guided on how to make a cancellation and obtained a refund.,5,1,2020-10-20 11:34:33,"Thank you for giving Shopee a 5-star review! We're excited to be part of your online shopping experience!

The Low Family ;D,"This is my 2nd review. I had a very very disappointing experience before as I felt cheated & that Shopee only protects seller. BUT I would say Shopee HAS IMPROVED and they do take care of buyer's interest.

There are lot of local sellers as well. But one suggestion. There are many shopee apps on play store for differnet countries but it very difficult to identify which app for which country. The names should be standardize or there should just be one app.,5,15,2020-08-06 23:35:15,"Thank you for giving Shopee a 5-star review! We're excited to be a part of your online shopping experience.
